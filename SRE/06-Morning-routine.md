# Morning routine

As part of the SRE framework to ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction, each systems engineer must follow the "morning routine." This routine usually takes 5 to 15 minutes

**Remember: Proactively addressing potential outages before they occur can save two to five times as much time compared to resolving the issue in emergency situations during nighttime.**

- Say hello to your colleagues : Indeed, since the majority of teams work remotely, it's always pleasant to greet your colleagues before starting the day. (and it acknowledge the fact that you are available for them, if they need) Check the various monitoring tools (Zabbix, Oncall, Kuma, Grafana) and ensure there are no pending alerts related to any of the platforms you are responsible for (or backup for)
- Check the #systeam-alerts on slack. It can give you a good overview of what happened during the night/week-end. see if you can do a quick help on some. Maybe you’re aware of some stuff and it will help team if you handle it.
    - Check my support tickets :
    - Ensure there are no unassigned tickets,
    - Ensure there are no tickets awaiting a response from me,
    - Make a quick answer on ticket you plane to handle in the day, is a good practice, it’s always good for the customer to know that you’ll take care of them today.
    - If possible, if I know a colleague is on vacation/sick leave, review their tickets to ensure clients are not waiting for a response.
- Check my gitlab account : Maybe a colleague is waiting for a review on a merge request.
- Grab a coffee , tea, or any other morning treat that could help you have a good day.
- Take a cold shower! Not a requirement.
