# Presentation

The SRE framework is an attempt to improve work, collaboration, knowledge and quality of service we deliver to our customers and the company.

The framework is structured around 4 pillars:

- The day-to-day routine every team member should do
- The [Responder](03-SRE-Responder.md) role, which implies to handle incoming tickets and alerts during the working day
- The [Archivist](02-SRE-Archivist.md) role, which implies to review and update documentation, whether as a housekeeping routine or following a change or an
incident, and doing some cleanup here and there
- The [On-call](07-SRE-Oncall.md) role, which implies to handle incidents and high priority tickets outside of business hours

You’ll find below dedicated pages for going through these different roles.

- The ***Morning routine*** is a good way to start your day-to-day work
- The ***On-call procedure*** and children pages will help you understand how the *On-call* role works

## Planning

In the same spirit than for the ***On-call*** role, the ***Responder*** and ***Archivist*** roles are based on a rotation called SRE shift.

The SRE shifts are **half-day sessions** during your working days, French public holidays excluded.

The calendar, planning and excluded days are available on the dedicated Shift SRE spreadsheet.

As part of the initial experimentation, **morning** and **afternoon** in the spreadsheet and planning are heard as French time. See below for the impact if you’re based on another location.

**Shifts for other countries-based members**

1. **Shifts for America-based members**
Team members on America are expected to do shifts during their local morning ( *“afternoon” on the shared planning* )

2. **Shifts for Asia-based members**
Team members on Asia are expected to do shifts during their local afternoon ( *“morning” on the shared planning* )

3. **Shifts for Africa-based members**
Team members in Africa are expected to do shifts during both slots as they are roughly on the same timezone than France.

## Communication

Communication is critical to the team in order to maintain a good quality of service, knowledge sharing and improve the way we’re handling problems and incidents.

For this, a few things are important:

- Prefer public or team channels instead of direct message for sharing information or asking questions
- Prefer email instead of slack for sharing an important information or requiring a specific attention
- Write down and share important things that you may talk about during calls
- Stay kind in the way you talk to each other
